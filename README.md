# Registration Page

App made with CRA, to complete the goal of making registration/login app with JWT set as cookie. No additional styling libraries were added. I used SASS to style app and practice my skills. Fill up the form to register in cloud Mongo DB. Feel free to view your profile, edit your data or remove account anytime you want.

You can see working version [here](https://dyrpit.github.io/registration-panel/).

## Backend

Server was build using NestJS framework to handle all frontend queries. NestJS is a TypeScript framework based on express under the hood. If you want to know more about NestJS click link [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). Rest API was made by me to practice my backend skills along with my TypeScript knowledge. You can see my server code on this repository [https://github.com/dyrpit/registration-backend](https://github.com/dyrpit/registration-backend)
